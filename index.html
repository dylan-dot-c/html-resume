         <span class="title"> <a href="https://www.joincolab.io/">Colab</a> :</span> Software Engineer Candidate [Jan 2024 - Mar 2024] Completed an 8 week
          program working on a cross-functional team of a designer, a product
          manager and 2 developers(myself included) implementing agile
          methodologies to build an MVP called WellNest(a collaborative health
          tracker for families).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            UI was carefully crafted by the designer and we provided our
            thoughts on how to make them feasible and more practical. We then
            implemented them using React Native with TypeScript plus the help of
            the React Native Elements UI library.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented login and signup with FireBase SDK and stored user
            information with FireStore.
          </li>
          <li>
            Application was deployed on the web using React-Native-Web and
            github pages for demo/colab day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Managed new features and existing bugs via a trello product board.

      <h3>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</h3>
      <span class="title"
        >Quiz Craft - Capstone Project || Coding Temple :</span
      >
      <p>
        Designed and deployed a comprehensive full-stack quiz application,
        enabling users to register, generate quizzes, share them, and view
        results.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a REST API using Flask, facilitating interactions with
          PostgreSQL for storing quizzes and user submissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrated the Open Trivia Database API to provide users with access
          to randomly generated quizzes based on specific topics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed a User Interface made with React+TS, which allowed type
          safety and a much more robust codebase. React-bootstrap was used for
          styling and interactivity using modals and overlays.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authentication and Authorization was done with Bearer tokens and Basic
          Auth with the help of flask_httpauth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deployed with Vercel(React-frontend) and Render(Flask-Backend) to
          facilitate CI/CD so that any pushes/pull requests merged to the main
          branch will trigger an automatic redeploy of the codebase.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="title">Clever Amnesia - Personal Project:</span> Github Repo
      <p>
        Remade the simple memory card game and added a competitive spin to it by
        recording the time and flips taken to solve a level of difficulty. Each
        new record would then be saved to the database. The leaderboard would
        then show top 10 records for each difficulty. Built with React,
        TailwindCSS, NODE and EXPRESS. I came back to the project after a few
        months and re-implemented the backend to use Supabase instead.
